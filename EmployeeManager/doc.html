            This is a C# and PostgreSQL-based employee management system designed to help organizations efficiently manage their employees, departments, and wage structures. The system provides complete CRUD functionality, allowing users to manage employee records, department information, and wage grades. It also includes reporting capabilities, enabling organizations to analyze employee wage data and department distributions. Through the use of the Blazor framework, the system offers a modern, responsive web interface, enhancing the user experience.

        <td>
            Businesses need to effectively manage their human resources data to improve organizational efficiency. Traditional paper records or simple spreadsheets struggle to meet the management needs of modern enterprises. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution that simplifies employee data management and improves the accuracy and efficiency of human resources decision-making. Additionally, this project serves as a practical application of object-oriented programming and database design principles.

<h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
<p>This project utilizes the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C# programming language</li>
    <li>Blazor frontend framework</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL database</li>
    <li>Dapper ORM framework</li>
    <li>Object-oriented design principles</li>
    <li>Layered architecture (data access layer, business logic layer, presentation layer)</li>
</ul>

<p>The system has implemented all the features described in the proposal, including complete CRUD operations, report generation, and user-friendly interface design. The code structure is clear, follows object-oriented programming principles, and provides a solid foundation for further expansion and maintenance.</p>
